I'm a software developer from Saigon :coffee:

Starting from 2019, I have tried and also continue to be a real contributor to open sources :first_quarter_moon_with_face:

* I write my dev notes at https://dev.to/vuong
* The posts at https://vuon9.medium.com/ are my translation about good articles I have read and have been interesting with.
